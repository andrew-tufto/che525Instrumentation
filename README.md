Explination of installed equipment:

We installed a level transmitter, coriolis flowmeter, pressure transmitter, and RTD. We assembled a charms controller and wired these instruments to the controller. The flowmeter is used to measure mass flow which is then able to use density to convert mass flow to volumetric flow. The level transmitter uses the length of flight time from the instrument to the surface to measure level. The pressure transmitter measures pressure. The RTD uses measured resistance to calculate temperature.
